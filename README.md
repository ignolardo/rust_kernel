##### Basic kernel for x86_64 systems.

This project was carried out following the ["Writing an Operating System in Rust"](https://os.phil-opp.com/) tutorial by Philipp Oppermann.

This is just to improve my skills in bare metal programming and to learn about the basics of operating systems.

Obviously, this kernel is not designed for use in real-world scenarios (although it could be) but to be studied to learn the fundamentals of any kernel.
